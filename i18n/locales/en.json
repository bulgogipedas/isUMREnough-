    "q1": {
      "question": "Where does this data come from?",
      "answer": "Per capita expenditure data comes from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) Indonesia 2024. UMR/UMP data comes from official governor decisions for each province. We update data annually following official publications."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is my salary data stored?",
      "answer": "Not at all. All calculations are done 100% in your browser (client-side). No data is sent to our servers. You can check yourself in the Network tab — no requests carry your personal data."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculation?",
      "answer": "This calculation is an estimate based on average per capita expenditure. Actual results may differ depending on lifestyle, specific location within the province, spending habits, and other personal factors. Use as initial guidance, not final decision."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What's the difference between per capita expenditure and UMR?",
      "answer": "Per capita expenditure is the average expenditure per person per month based on BPS surveys. UMR (Regional Minimum Wage) is the minimum salary standard set by the government. They can differ significantly — for example, UMR can be higher than average expenditure."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Why are some provinces in deficit?",
      "answer": "Some provinces have UMR lower than average per capita expenditure. This indicates that workers with UMR salaries in those provinces may struggle to meet basic needs without additional income."
